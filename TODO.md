# Implementation Plan for 12-Hour Format Business Hours

## Steps:

- [ ] Update the initialFormData to include sub-states for open and close time components (openHour, openMinute, openPeriod, closeHour, closeMinute, closePeriod).
- [ ] Add a useEffect hook to compute and update the full 12-hour time strings (businessHours.open and businessHours.close) whenever the sub-states change.
- [ ] Define a TimePicker functional component using Select for hours (1-12), minutes (00-59), and AM/PM.
- [ ] Replace the native time Input elements in step 3 of the form with TimePicker components for open and close times.
- [ ] Verify validation, review section display, and PDF generation use the new 12-hour format strings correctly.
- [ ] Test the form: Select various times, ensure computation works, validation triggers if incomplete, and no errors in console.
- [ ] Update this TODO with completion status after each step.
