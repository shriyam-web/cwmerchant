# Digital Support Dynamic Data Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated dynamic data fetching from the database for the Digital Support tab in the dashboard. The component now displays real-time data from MongoDB instead of hardcoded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route Update (`app/api/merchant/dashboard/route.ts`)
**Added digital support data to the API response:**
- `totalGraphics`: Total graphics design limit
- `totalReels`: Total video reels limit
- `totalPodcast`: Total podcast limit
- `completedPodcast`: Number of completed podcasts
- `isWebsite`: Website build status
- `ds_graphics`: Array of graphics design requests
- `ds_reel`: Array of video reel requests
- `ds_weblog`: Array of website development logs
- `podcastLog`: Array of podcast production logs

### 2. Digital Support Component (`components/dashboard/digital-support.tsx`)
**Major Updates:**

#### a. Dynamic Request History
- Removed hardcoded request data
- Added `useMemo` hook to transform database data into request history format
- Processes data from:
  - `ds_graphics` → Graphics design requests
  - `ds_reel` → Video reel requests
  - `podcastLog` → Podcast production requests
  - `ds_weblog` → Website development requests
- Automatically sorts requests by date (most recent first)
- Maps database status values to UI status ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed')

#### b. Dynamic Support Services
- Removed hardcoded support limits
- Added `useMemo` hook to calculate usage dynamically:
  - **Graphics Design**: Shows `used/total` based on `ds_graphics.length` and `totalGraphics`
  - **Video Reels**: Shows `used/total` based on `ds_reel.length` and `totalReels`
  - **Podcast Production**: Shows `used/total` based on `podcastLog.length` and `totalPodcast`
  - **Website Development**: Shows build status based on `isWebsite` boolean
- Added division-by-zero protection for progress calculations
- Progress bars now accurately reflect actual usage

#### c. Empty State Handling
- Displays "No requests yet" message when no digital support requests exist
- Shows 0/0 usage when merchant has no allocated limits

### 3. Dashboard Page Update (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
**Fixed merchant prop passing:**
- Updated line 767 to pass `merchant` prop to `DigitalSupport` component
- Ensures component receives current merchant data for dynamic rendering

## Database Schema Reference

The component now reads from these MongoDB fields in the Partner schema:

```typescript
// Limits
totalGraphics: number
totalReels: number
totalPodcast: number
completedPodcast: number
isWebsite: boolean

// Request Arrays
ds_graphics: [{
  graphicId: string
  requestDate: Date
  completionDate?: Date
  status: 'completed' | 'pending'
  requestCategory: string
  content: string
  subject: string
  isSchedules?: boolean
}]

ds_reel: [{
  reelId: string
  requestDate: Date
  completionDate?: Date
  status: 'completed' | 'pending'
  content: string
  subject: string
}]

podcastLog: [{
  title: string
  scheduleDate: Date
  completeDate?: Date
  status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'pending'
}]

ds_weblog: [{
  weblog_id: string
  status: 'completed' | 'pending'
  completionDate?: Date
  description: string
}]
```

## Features

### ✅ Real-time Data Display
- Support limits reflect actual package allocation
- Usage counters update based on request history
- Request history shows all submitted requests with status

### ✅ Accurate Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars show percentage utilized
- Handles edge cases (0 total, 0 used)
- Color-coded status indicators

### ✅ Request History
- Displays all digital support requests across all types
- Shows submission and completion dates
- Status badges (pending, in progress, completed)
- Sorted by most recent first

### ✅ Empty States
- Graceful handling when no data exists
- Informative messages for merchants with no requests
- Shows 0 limits when package not allocated

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with merchant having no digital support data:**
   - Should show 0/0 for all services
   - Should display "No requests yet" message

2. **Test with merchant having partial data:**
   - Some services with limits, others without
   - Some requests completed, others pending

3. **Test with merchant having full data:**
   - All services with limits and usage
   - Multiple requests in different statuses
   - Website built vs not built

4. **Test edge cases:**
   - Division by zero (0 total limits)
   - Invalid dates
   - Missing optional fields

## Future Enhancements

1. Add filtering for request history (by type, status)
2. Add request submission functionality
3. Add download/view completed work
4. Add notifications for completed requests
5. Add analytics dashboard for digital support usage
