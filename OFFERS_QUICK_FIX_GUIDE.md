# Offers Management - Quick Fix Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Edit & Delete Not Working ❌ → ✅
**Root Cause:** Old offers don't have `_id` fields because schema had `_id: false`

**Solution:**
- Changed schema to `_id: true` 
- Created migration endpoint to fix old offers
- Added migration banner in UI

### Issue 2: Both Discounts Required ❌ → ✅
**Root Cause:** Validation required both discount value AND percent

**Solution:**
- Updated validation to require only ONE discount type
- Merchants can now enter:
  - Just discount value (e.g., ₹500 off)
  - Just discount percent (e.g., 20% off)
  - Both (optional)

### Issue 3: Valid Until Required for Inactive ❌ → ✅
**Root Cause:** Valid until date was always required

**Solution:**
- Auto-clears valid until when status changed to "Inactive"
- Disables date field for inactive offers
- Only requires date for Active offers

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Fetched offers: [...]
Offer 0: { title: "...", hasId: true, id: "..." }
Updating offer with ID: ...
Delete response: { success: true, ... }
```

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Edit/Delete buttons are grayed out
- **Cause:** Offer doesn't have `_id`
- **Fix:** Click "Migrate Now" button in yellow banner

**Problem:** "Offer not found" error
- **Cause:** Old offer without `_id`
- **Fix:** Use migration feature

**Problem:** Can't create offer with just one discount
- **Cause:** Old validation still cached
- **Fix:** Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
