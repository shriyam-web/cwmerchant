# Product Delete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete product deletion functionality that removes products from MongoDB and deletes associated images from Cloudinary.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route - `/app/api/merchant/products/route.ts`
Added a new `DELETE` endpoint that:
- Accepts `merchantId` and `productId` as query parameters
- Finds the product in MongoDB
- Deletes all product images from Cloudinary
- Removes the product reference from the partner's products array
- Deletes the product document from MongoDB
- Returns success/error response

**Key Features:**
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` to handle multiple image deletions gracefully
- Continues with product deletion even if some images fail to delete from Cloudinary
- Properly extracts Cloudinary public_id from image URLs
- Cleans up all references to maintain data integrity

### 2. Products Management Component - `/components/dashboard/products-management.tsx`
Enhanced the component with:
- Confirmation dialog using AlertDialog component
- Loading states during deletion
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Proper error handling

**New State Variables:**
- `deleteDialogOpen` - Controls the confirmation dialog visibility
- `productToDelete` - Stores the product ID to be deleted
- `isDeleting` - Tracks deletion operation status

**New Functions:**
- `handleDeleteProduct(productId)` - Opens confirmation dialog
- `confirmDeleteProduct()` - Executes the deletion via API call

### 3. Products Form Hook - `/components/dashboard/products-management/use-products-form.ts`
- Exported `fetchProducts` function to allow refreshing the products list after deletion

## User Flow

1. User clicks the delete button (trash icon) on a product card
2. A confirmation dialog appears with a warning message
3. User confirms deletion
4. The system:
   - Shows "Deleting..." state on the button
   - Calls the DELETE API endpoint
   - Deletes product images from Cloudinary
   - Removes product from MongoDB
   - Updates the partner's products array
5. Success toast notification appears
6. Products list automatically refreshes
7. Dialog closes

## Error Handling

- Validates merchant ID and product ID
- Handles product not found scenarios
- Gracefully handles Cloudinary deletion failures
- Shows user-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Logs errors to console for debugging

## API Endpoint

**DELETE** `/api/merchant/products?merchantId={id}&productId={id}`

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Product and images deleted successfully",
  "productId": "CW-XXX"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Dependencies Used

- `cloudinary` - For image deletion
- `@/components/ui/alert-dialog` - For confirmation dialog
- `@/hooks/use-toast` - For notifications
- `mongoose` - For MongoDB operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test deleting a product with multiple images
2. Test deleting a product with no images
3. Test with invalid product ID
4. Test with invalid merchant ID
5. Test canceling the deletion
6. Verify images are removed from Cloudinary dashboard
7. Verify product is removed from MongoDB
8. Verify partner's products array is updated

## Security Considerations

- Validates merchant ID before deletion
- Ensures only products belonging to the merchant can be deleted
- Uses proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Future Enhancements

- Add soft delete functionality (mark as deleted instead of permanent deletion)
- Add bulk delete functionality
- Add undo functionality with a grace period
- Add audit logging for deletions
