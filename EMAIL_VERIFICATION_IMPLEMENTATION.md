## 🔄 How It Works

### Email Verification Flow:

1. **User logs in** → Dashboard checks `emailVerified` status
2. **If not verified** → Banner appears at top of dashboard
3. **User clicks "Verify Email Now"** → OTP sent to email
4. **Dialog opens** → User enters 6-digit OTP
5. **User clicks "Verify"** → OTP validated
6. **Success** → Email marked as verified, banner disappears

### OTP Email Content:
- Professional branded template
- Clear OTP display (large, centered)
- 10-minute validity notice
- Security information
- CityWitty branding
